       A Python Isometric Game Engine


============
Introduction
============

i-so-myr: (n) Any of one or more scenes with the same measurements in
foreground and background, that have different properties and can exist in any
of several game worlds for a measurable period of time.

Isomyr is an isometric game engine based on Pygame, and written in Python. A
fork of the Isotope game engine, it provides the framework for constructing an
isometric graphics game with actors who can pick up and drop objects, jump onto
plaforms, and move about in projected 3d isometric environments.


========
Features
========

* Actors: used for player and monster game objects. Capable of facing, gravity,
  collision response, jumping, automation and inventory.

* Multiframe animation and images.

* Simple physics simulation of velocity, collision and touch detection.

* All objects can be customised and extended using Python.


============
Dependencies
============

Isomyr currently has the following dependencies:

* pygame - http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

* NumPy - http://www.scipy.org/Download

On Ubuntu, you can do the following:

 $ sudo apt-get install python-pygame python-numpy


============
Installation
============

Development
-----------

If you want to develop for txSpore or use the latest code we're working on, you
can install from the sources. You'll need bzr installed, and then just do the
following::

    $ bzr branch lp:isomyr
    $ cd isomyr
    $ sudo python setup.py install


Easy Install
------------

You can use the setuptools easy_install script to get txSpore on your system::

    $ sudo easy_install Isomyr


Manual Download
---------------

You can manually download the source tarball from the Python Package Index by
visiting the following URL:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Isomyr/

You'll need to untar and gunzip the source, cd into the source directory, and
then you can do the usual::

    $ sudo python setup.py install


Checking the Source
-------------------

Once installed, you can test the source code by executing this from the
top-level source directory::

    $ ./admin/testDocs.py
    $ ./admin/testRunner.py

That will run the test suite and report on the success and failure of any unit
tests.


=====
Usage
=====


Examples
--------

In the top-level source directory for Isomyr, there is an examples directory.
This contains the following:

* The original example from Isotope, ported to work with Isomyr. This is a
  two-room world where a player can pick up two objects and jump on a bed.

* A new open ground example with 14 "rooms" that represent an outside
  environment.  This example simply shows moving between many connected and
  unwalled scenes.

Examining each of the Python files in the example directories is the best way
to get a sense of how to use Isomyr to create a game.

The examples may be run from the top-level source directory, for example::

  $ python examples/TwoRooms/tworooms.py

You may navigate the player with the arrow keys, <SPACE> for jump, and <ENTER>
for use.


==========
Known Bugs
==========

* When increasing the player velocity, their jumping height also increases.
  When it's high enough, the player can jump out of the scene. This may require
  that ceilings be placed on rooms... but the jumping physics should be
  examined as well.

Misc
----

* Add unit tests for world.World.setWorldTime.

* Add unit tests for time change method.

* Add season definitions and season-tracking to Calendar.

* Add a wrapper for managing sprites (related postion vectors, sizing, etc.;
  see code in isometric.py.

* Add support for ConfigParser engine/game configuration.

* Add a sandbox example for drawing just a wall.

* Add logging for all actions (for easy debugging in the console).

* Provide a configuration mechanism whereby game developers can define a
  titlebar image.

* Locate all XXX comments, fix them, and remove them.

* Rename all some_thing methods and variables to someThing.

* Add more unit tests.


Example Tasks
-------------

* Create an example where a yogi sits on top of a mountain and seasonal events
  take place (visual updates to the background images, textual updates to the
  console).

* Create an example with a time demo where time passes differently in different
  rooms (doors would be teleports to other worlds with different calendars).
  (NOTE: this one might not be needed, once the previous two are
  implemented...)

* Create an example with examinable object (maybe a book is a good demo for
  this).

* Create an example with explodable objects

* Create an example with procedurally-generated background images/grids/etc.

* Create an example with a "room" that has multiple terrain types; walking over
  them demostrates the fractional player velocities as determined by the
  terrain.


Docs
----

* Update the docs with information about the perspective ratio used by Isomyr.


DirectedAnimatedSkin
--------------------

* Split out getImage into separate methods.

* Give a method name for every direction.


World Building
--------------

* For the new Thing objects, make sure that if an object with children is added
  to a world, that all the children get their world attribute set properly.

* Add support for parsing an ASCII map to generate a room.

* Add support for Tiled maps

  - http://mapeditor.org/

  - http://code.google.com/p/python-pyknic/source/browse/trunk/pyknic/resources/

* Provide default skinning for objects that don't have skins. Maybe just lots
  of grey with grids on them (spaced to whatever the base unit is for objects).

* Start providing a set of sample objects, pre-skinned, ready to be inserted
  into games. This should have:

  - a skin

  - size, velocity, weight, and all other attributes pre-defined

  - a sprite factory that would be used by the engine


Player Tweaks
-------------

* When a player picks up an item, that should re-parent the item (new parent =
  player).

* When a player drops an itme, that should re-parent the item (new parent =
  scene).

* Changes to scenes, players, etc., should cause a refresh to happen in the
  scene. The engine shouldn't have to check for individual object changes.

  - add an object history-tracking mechanism

* Player sensation occurs in the engine right now... this is not a good
  abstraction. Player examination should be an interaction between player and
  object, within the context of the world (or more practically, within the
  context of a given scene).

* Add the ability to have various forms of clothing and to be able to swap them
  out in-game.


Engine Improvements
-------------------

* Engine.start refers to pygame.time.get_ticks -- let's put a wrapper for this
  in our own gametime instance.

* Define the mathematical relationship between the following:

  - player character size and scene boundaries

  - background size/placement and scene boundaries

* Allow the perspective ratio to be configurable. (prototype in the sandbox)

* Write a floor/grid-generating utility function. (prototype in the sandbox)

  - Allow grid elements to be controlled run-time (e.g., changing tile colors
    dynamically).


Multiple Skin Supprt
--------------------

* Add support for objects to have differnt skins that would be switched based
  upon environmental factors (e.g., broken windows, limping players, sitting
  players).


Physics
-------

* Time

  - worlds need to define degree of axial tilt, length of day, length of year

  - scenes need to indicate location on globe so that daylight hours can be
    determined; they also need to define seasons, correlate them to the times
    of the year, indicate starting season (time of year) and starting time of
    day

* Weather

 - type of atmosphere

 - distance of the sun from the planet

 - worlds need to define an average global temperature

 - based on this, highs and lows need to be calculated for various latitudes

 - similarly for the seasons, with axial tilt taken into consideration

 - weather conditions should be predefined based on latititude, season, global
   temperature, axial tilt, etc., (as well as allowable transitions from one
   type of weather to another)

* Planetary bodies

 - type of sun, color of light

 - configurable moon count

 - mass/visibility of moons

 - light level given off by each moon

 - regularity of visible meteor activity

* Movement on world surface

 - worlds need to define mass so that gravity, rate of fall, weights of
   objects, etc., can be calculated

 - objects also need to indicate their masses

 - visually, movement could take place in outdoor and indoor scenes, but could
   also take place at a top-down map-level, allowing for an interactive and
   visual means of traversing great distances

* Add a map-view for traversing long distances (across continents), with moving
  red dot for player. Traversal across mountains, desert, etc., would be slower
  than plains or movement on roads.

* Add support for fractional velocities.

  - it seems that this won't be possible with the current isometric transform,
    as it uses bit-shifting.

* Add gravity multiplier for rate of fall (this goes on world instances).

  - this affects velocity of fall as well as traversal speeds across the
    surface

  - this affects weight of objects.

* Add terrain traversal modifiers (that augment player velocity)... e.g.,
  pavement, sand, mud, water.

* Allow players to pull objects.

* Pushing and pulling objects should affect player velocity (depending upon the
  weight of the object and the surface over which they are being pushed or
  pulled). This is going to require fractional velocity values.


Save Games
----------

* Store object positions (most importantly, player).

* Store inventory.

* Record game time elapsed.

* Record real-time elapsed.

  - need to support annotating player classes with metadata


Mouse Support
-------------

* Currently, character movement is keys-only. It'd be good to add
  mouse-directed player movement.


Distance
--------

* Distance in scenes needs to be quantified:

  - sound volumes will depend upon it

  - the amound of ground covered by a walking character will depend upon it

* Distance should be proportional to object sizes


Sound and Music
---------------

* Walking surfaces should have sounds associated with them... probably walkable
  surfaces should have the ability to define "sound zones" so that adding sound
  for the following would be possibile:

  - two rooms in a scene, one with a wood floor and and the other carpeted;

  - an out-doors scene with grass, sand, rock, etc., surfaces

  - however... the quality and volume of the sound made while walking is
    dictated by the walker... so perhaps walkers should have footsteps "skins"
    for each type of surface they could walk over...

* There should be a "sound generator" object (SoundableThing?) that sets an
  audibility radius, has an associated sound file (or procedural sound code...
  maybe a class), there should be an intensity fall-off with distance from
  source.

  - better than a radius, an object should define an intensity, and the audible
    radius can be calculated from that

  - perhaps there should be audio "skins" for objects, in the same way that
    there are image/animation skins... various sound properties could be
    defined by the skins

  - as an object which is capable of perceiving (e.g., the player, an enemy, an
    NPC) traverses a scene, all sound-emitting objects need to be iterated
    through at each step to determine if they are in range of perception, and
    if so, the level to which the volume should be set for that sound... this
    is going to depend upon the metric defined for scenes...

* Walls and doors should have sound-dampening characteristics that can be set.

* Ambient sound loops need to be supported, with sound zones like the footsteps
  example above.

* Similarly, background music needs to be supported.


Complex Interactions
--------------------

* The idea of having weather simulation sparked another idea: events registered
  for various world or scene changes. For instance, a farmer NPC could
  subscribe to weather. Weather transitions could call
  notify(WeatherChange(last, current), and if the transition is defined as
  harmful to crops (mist->rain is cool, drought->downpour is bad, anything to
  hail is bad, etc.) then the farmer NPCs could emote dramatically, rush about,
  leave taverns in a hurry, etc.


Networking Support
------------------

* Support multiple servers for load-balancing purposes.

* Use RabbitMQ for message exchange.

* Use txAMQP for client code.
